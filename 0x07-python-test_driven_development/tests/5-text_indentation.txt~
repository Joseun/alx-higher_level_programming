 How to Use 5-text_indentation.py
===============================

This library is very simple, since it only has one function called
``text_indentation()``.

Strings
=======

``text_indentation()`` prints a text placing a new line at delimiters ".", "?",
		       ":".

::

    >>> text_indentation = __import__('5-text_indentation').text_indentation
    >>> text_indentation("I am, a fine boy: even if I? haven't seen her. Yet.")
    I am, a fine boy:
    <BLANKLINE>
    even if I?
    <BLANKLINE>
    haven't seen her.
    <BLANKLINE>
    Yet.

Non-Strings
===========

``text_indentation()`` raises a TypeError if the argument is not a strings

::

    >>> text_indentation(100000)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: text must be a string
